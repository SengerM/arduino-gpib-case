# arduino-gpib-case

This repository contains an [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) 3D model for the case of the Arduino-GPIB project. The case is intended to be printed with a 3D printer. The case is fully parametrized so you can easily adapt it to your needs, see the definitions in the begining of the file ```main.scad```.

The firmware for the Arduino board (i.e. the ```.ino``` file) can be found in the [arduino-gpib-firmware](https://github.com/SengerM/arduino-gpib-firmware) repository.
